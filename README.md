Jasne — poprawiłem to **na bardziej techniczne, czystsze i “inwestor-/dev-grade”**, bez marketingowego bełkotu, ale nadal mocne.

## Boson Infinity — Energy-Defined Layer-0 Blockchain

Boson Infinity is an energy-defined Layer-0 blockchain designed around **real computational cost**, **GPU-efficient Proof-of-Work**, and **strictly transparent monetary rules**.

The protocol links coin issuance and valuation directly to measurable energy and hash cost, eliminating speculative supply manipulation, hidden incentives, and artificial scarcity models.

Boson Infinity is built from first principles as a minimal, auditable base layer — without EVM, without smart-contract bloat, and without centralized control.

## Key Features

* **SHA-512 Proof-of-Work** optimized for modern GPUs
* **High-throughput GPU mining** with low hardware entry barrier
* **DAG-assisted PoW scaling** for efficient block propagation
* **Energy-defined monetary model**
  (coin cost derived from real joules per hash and electricity pricing)
* **Fixed hard cap supply** with deterministic halving schedule
* **Zero premine, zero founders’ allocation, zero VC issuance**
* **Treasury funded exclusively via protocol-level block rewards (20%)**
* **Minimal Layer-0 architecture**
  (no EVM, no smart contracts, no external dependencies)
* **Fully transparent math and consensus rules**
* **No hidden mechanics, no discretionary minting**
