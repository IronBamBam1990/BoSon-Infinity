# Boson Infinity — Energy-Defined Layer-0 Blockchain

Boson Infinity is a new Layer-0 blockchain focused on energy-priced currency,
GPU-optimized hashing (SHA-512), DAG-enhanced PoW scaling, and full
decentralization with zero premine, zero VC, and minimal hardware requirements.

## Key Features

- SHA-512 Proof-of-Work
- GPU mining with high throughput
- DAG-assisted block propagation and scaling
- Energy-defined monetary model (price linked to real computational and energy cost)
- Zero premine, zero founders’ allocation, zero VC
- Minimalistic Layer-0 architecture (no EVM, no smart contract bloat)
- Transparent mathematics, no hidden mechanics
